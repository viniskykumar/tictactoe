# Tic Tac Toe
Tic-tac-toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to get three of your symbols (either "X" or "O") in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before your opponent does. The game is simple yet challenging, and it's often used as a fun way to introduce basic strategic thinking.
